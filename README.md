## Moisture-content-using-sensor
Water content through the oven-dry method is often time-consuming, while utilizing a rapid moisture meter, though efficient, can be energy-intensive when employed Determining consistently over an extended duration. 

In this project, we aim to speed up the process of getting results while studying how soil behave in relation to water content and other factors.

The project revolves around calibrating the sensor module based on local conditions and subsequently using the sensor probe to obtain real-time, in situ water content measurements at any given location.
